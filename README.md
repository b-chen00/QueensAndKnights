# Project QueensAndKnights

## Summary/Description
This project covers two algorithms which are the Knight's Tour and N-Queens. In the Knight's Tour, the algorithm will find whether a knight is able to legally move to every spot on a chess board without stepping on the same spot twice starting on any spot. If it is possible, it will also give the different number of ways it can be achieved. Chess board size can vary as well. The N-Queens tries to see if it is possible to place n queens on a n x n board without any queens attacking each other. This algorithm will take a board size and produce the number of solutions. This project is written in Java. A simple test is included to test the two algorithms.

## How to Run the Project:  
### Requirements:
Install Java JDK 1.8.

### Run the project:
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into that directory.
2. `cd` into the respective folder of the algorithm that you want to use.
3. Compile the testing file using `javac Driver.java`.
4. Use `java Driver` to run the test.
5. Optionally, edit **Driver.java** to change the 5 or so test cases present.

### To-do
- Test both algorithms extensively and check for edge cases such as a board of size 0 or a starting position not on the board.
